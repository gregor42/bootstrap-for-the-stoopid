This is where I start keeping track of my progress & making stupid comments
Like first off - WTF? Does Bootstrap require JQuery?  SRSLY? WTF?

And there's like a zillion other things that I supposedly need:
Less
Grunt
fucking Node.js??
bower / npm / composer



WTF dudes?  So much for "only uses HTML & JS so works with anything" - what a pile of shit

This is me being cluelessAF and experimenting with Bootstrap

Frankly I dont know why you would find this interesting at all - go read a tutorial & learn this stuff on your own... ugh WTF?
